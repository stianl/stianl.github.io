title: Comparing DNS servers
---

An interesting topic came up at work today regarding the performance and security features of DNS servers. A colleague of mine pointed me to an interesting new service launched by Norwegian Internet security firm (Mnemonic)[http://www.mnemonic.no]. The service is a type of free and secure DNS service 
that protects users from malicious sites by resolving addresses to them to their "sinkhole" site. Sounds like a good idea, especially for users who needs 
that kind of protection agains themselves (e.g. your average Internet citizen).

Now, I've been a long time user of Google free public DNS offering and been really happy with the service, and as I'm not a huge fan of filtering DNS servers I probably won't switch - unless the performance of Mnemonic's service is better. I've always "felt" that Google DNS performed better than my ISP's own DNS servers. Feeling, is as we know, a very, very dangerous thing to do in the IT world, which brings me to the point of this article. Let's measure the performance and bring some raw, qualified data to the table!


Let's compare some public DNS servers with some ISP DNS servers!

* Google public DNS servers
* Mnemonic free and secure public DNS service (AWS hosted)
* Get ISP
